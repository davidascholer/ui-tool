# Quickstart: Drag-and-Drop UI Builder

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and pnpm/npm
- Vite React project
- Tailwind CSS configured

## Install

```bash
npm i
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

## Notes

- Use the Builder page to assemble Pages → Containers → Components.
- Toggle code view (React/React Native) and copy to clipboard.
- Edit selected entity options via the Drawer using react-hook-form + zod.
- Analytics events sent via controller wrappers; UI never calls network directly.
