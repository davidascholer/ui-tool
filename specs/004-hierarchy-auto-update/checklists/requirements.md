# Specification Quality Checklist: Real-Time Hierarchy Updates in UI Preview

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: December 3, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Feature focuses on enhancing existing hierarchy view with real-time updates
- Success criteria include specific performance metrics (200ms response, 60 FPS, etc.)
- Edge cases cover performance, error handling, and user experience scenarios
