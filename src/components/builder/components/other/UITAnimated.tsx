/**
 * React Native:
 * The Animated library is designed to make animations fluid, powerful, and painless to build and maintain. Animated focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, configurable transforms in between, and start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution. The core workflow for creating an animation is to create an Animated.Value, hook it up to one or more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates via animations using Animated.timing().
