/**
 * React Native:
 * A foundational component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard. Props provide configurability for several features, such as auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard types, such as a numeric keypad.
The most basic use case is to plop down a TextInput and subscribe to the onChangeText events to read the user input. There are also other events, such as onSubmitEditing and onFocus that can be subscribed to.
